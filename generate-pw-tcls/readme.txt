The atoms names and pathtraj commands will remain the same for all the proteins. However, be cautious about 2e0i with two FAD molecules.

Use this script to generate pathways submission scripts for each donor. In a given output script, pathways is called for a given donor (FAD) atom to each acceptor (CPD) atom over the entire simulation.

For each protein, update the dcd file names, etc. with the relevant ones.
From terminal window, use:
python Ben.py

The files are generated in the same directory.
